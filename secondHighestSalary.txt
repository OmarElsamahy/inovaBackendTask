Given table 
Employee -> {id, salary}; id is the primary key
Write an SQL query to report the second highest salary from the Employee table. If there is no second highest salary, the query should report NULL

SELECT MAX(salary) AS second_highest_salary
FROM Employee
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employee);

Explanation:

The subquery (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employee) will get the highest salary from Employee table.
The main query will select the max salary that is less than the highest salary retrieved by the subquery. giving second highest salary.
If there is no salary that is less than the highest salary, the query will return NULL.
